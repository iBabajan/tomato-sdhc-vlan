=== Changelog (deprecated) ===

Here's a short/brief list of features currently implemented/available on branch VLAN-GUI v8 as of today (2011-07-29):

 * up to 4 LAN bridges can be set up via web interface
 * each LAN bridge must have it's own IP address/netmask set
 * DHCP server can be enabled/configured independently for/on each LAN bridge (i.e. different IP ranges, lease times)
 * Spanning Tree Protocol can be enabled/disabled on each bridge individually
 * WLAN can be assigned to be part of any existing/configured LAN bridge, not just the primary LAN (br0)
 * when/if enabled, the web management interface on the router should be accessible from/on all LAN bridges
 * up to 16 VLANs can be created/configured on the device (with VIDs ranging from 0 to 15)
 * each VLAN can be configured/treated as: WAN, part of a LAN bridge or unassigned
 * in general, each individual/physical ethernet port on the device can be assigned as a member/participant of a single VLAN
 * on devices (known) to support tagging of ethernet frames, it's possible to configure one (physical) ethernet port as a 802.1q trunk (member of multiple VLANs)
 * static routes can be added/configured onto specific LAN bridges
 * MiniuPnPd, RIP and IGMPproxy can be configured to listen/bind only on selected/enabled interfaces
 * LAN bridges are isolated from each other by default (not accessible to each other)
 * access/communication between different LAN bridges can be configured via web interface
 * code based on TomatoUSB 1.28.8754
And there's also a (non-exhaustive) list of known issues, limitations and warnings (aka things you show consider/know about VLAN-GUI before trying it out):

 * as bridge br0 is supposed to be the 'primary' LAN interface, it cannot be deleted and must always have a IP valid address set
 * if a default gateway is set, it must be reachable via br0 (being the primary LAN interface)
 * each LAN bridge must have it's own IP address/netmask set (if a LAN bridge is created and a proper IP address/netmask pair is not set or... if two different LAN bridges are configured with similar/conflicting IP addresses and/or overlapping subnets, the outcome/results can be unpredictable)
 * although it's possible to create/configure up to 16 VLANs on devices like the WRT54GL (and possibly even more VLANs on other devices), it's usually a good idea to avoid using VID 0 to prevent 802.1q compatibility issues (as 802.1q specifies that frames tagged with VID 0 do not belong to any VLAN).
 * since a lot of code in Tomato assumes there's only one bridge/LAN (br0), we can probably/safely assume that any functionality/feature not mentioned above should be, most likely, restricted to work/function only on/with br0 (i.e. WDS/hotplugging, ondemand PPP dialing, OpenVPN-related things, etc...)
 * ipv6 support is uncertain to say the least (absolutely no testing has been done so far) 

Tested partially/only tested on these models:
 * WRT54GL v1.x , WRT54G v2 
 * RT-N16, E3000
 * Netgear WNR3500L

=== Older Versions ===

Not exactly a 'proper' changelog - but close - this is a raw/partial copy of 'git log' on my local repo:

commit a27d2bf7d91eb9de2be7926272cdc919f78f2b0b
Author: Augusto Bott <augusto@bott.com.br>
Date:   Fri Jun 24 03:05:55 2011 -0300

 * New CPU frequency detection, flash size (status-overview) and updates on various GUI pages (mostly, adding notes and navigation menu layout).

commit 1a3deeb707d732921a68bc964467539aa9d460ad
Author: Augusto Bott <augusto@bott.com.br>
Date:   Wed Jun 22 07:55:37 2011 -0300

 * Corrected a bug on advanced-vlan.asp introduced on the previous commit, which was preventing the form from submitting (related to experimental settings/trunk_vlan_support_override).

commit c7cb00279fae2f215f10920ab32722deb3f35a62
Author: Augusto Bott <augusto@bott.com.br>
Date:   Wed Jun 22 03:50:39 2011 -0300

 * Minor change due to how BASH was (mis)interpreting dot (aka source) on recent versions of Ubuntu

commit 323c66296ef51b87e23904b1968995f79955c0f0
Author: Augusto Bott <augusto@bott.com.br>
Date:   Mon Jun 20 03:15:42 2011 -0300

 * Instead of checking against boardtype, VLAN support for a particular router model is now checked against boardflags (BFL_ENETVLAN, 0x0100). Trunk-based VLAN support is still checked against boardtype, but the GUI now has a checkbox available to allow overriding this check (for experimental purposes, perhaps). Physical port-ordering checks against a few additional boardtypes: WRT54GL 1.x, WL-520GU, WL-500G Premium v2, WRT54GS 2.x, WRT320N/E2000, WRT610Nv2/E3000 (not thoroughly tested). As internal switch-port-number can be different according to each router model (5 on FastE, 8 on GigE), it's now 'detected' while reading configuration from NVRAM (also not thoroughly tested, but all information found so far suggests it should work across all of them).
