Not exactly a 'proper' changelog - but close - this is a raw/partial copy of 'git log' on my local repo:

commit 323c66296ef51b87e23904b1968995f79955c0f0
Author: Augusto Bott <augusto@bott.com.br>

 * Instead of checking against boardtype, VLAN support for a particular router model is now checked against boardflags (BFL_ENETVLAN, 0x0100). Trunk-based VLAN support is still checked against boardtype, but the GUI now has a checkbox available to allow overriding this check (for experimental purposes, perhaps). Physical port-ordering checks against a few additional boardtypes: WRT54GL 1.x, WL-520GU, WL-500G Premium v2, WRT54GS 2.x, WRT320N/E2000, WRT610Nv2/E3000 (not thoroughly tested). As internal switch-port-number can be different according to each router model (5 on FastE, 8 on GigE), it's now 'detected' while reading configuration from NVRAM (also not thoroughly tested, but all information found so far suggests it should work across all of them).
